This is a script made in Python using the TETR.IO API which will scan the top 50 players every 10 minutes and report any relevant changes.
It's worth noting that the first update will appear 10 minutes after initially running the script.

Updates may include the following tags:
[Normal] - A player beat an opponent with a lower rank than them.
[Upset] - A player lost to an opponent with a lower rank than them.
[Promotion] - A player recently entered the specified rank range.
[Demotion] - A player recently fell out of the specified rank range.
